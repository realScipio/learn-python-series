    "# Learn Python Series (#28) - Using Pickle and Shelve\n",
    "Welcome to episode #28 of the `Learn Python Series`! In [episode #15](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@scipio/learn-python-series-15-handling-json) we focused our attention on the JSON file format and reading from and writing to `.json` files. JSON is language- and platform-independent and human-readable as well. It can be used to serialize / deserialize JSON data to and from Python objects, and because `.json` files can be stored on disk they can also be shared among processes and computer systems. However, great as JSON might be, for serializing / de-serializing Python objects, it does have its limitations, for not all Python object formats can be \"JSON-i-fied\": JSON for example doesn't properly differentiate between lists and tuples, object keys are required to be strings, and datetime objects could be customized to work with JSON but not \"out-of-the-box\" (requires custom (de)serialization). Also, there are situations where \"human-readable\" could be considered a security risk, ergo not in every situation using JSON is preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pickle vs JSON\n",
    "`Pickle`, which as a module is part of most Python distributions (including Anaconda), can also be used for serializing and de-serializing Python objects. \"Pickling\" out-of-the-box converts **almost any** Python object (apart from a few edge-case scenarios, like generators and lambda functions, which we haven't discussed yet in earlier episodes) into a character stream that can be saved to disk, where the character stream contains all the information that's needed to rebuild the object by the same or another Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could pickle the following object types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- normal and unicode strings\n",
    "- integers, floats, complex numbers\n",
    "- lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets\n",
    "- None, True and False\n",
    "- (built-in) functions and classes defined at a module's top level\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nota bene:**\n",
    "As opposed to JSON however, Pickle is **not** platform independent (it can even vary per Python version), it's rather slow, uses a binary format (ergo not human-readable), and could be a security risk for executing arbitrary code, contained in the pickle, while de-serializating. So while this last sentence might not sound like a great sales-pitch to make a case for using Pickle, if you don't have language interoperability requirements for exchanging serialized objects, if you don't have to deal with untrusted data sources and if a binary format is OK or even preferred, then Pickle works great!\n",

    "# Learn Python Series (#23) - Handling Regular Expressions Part 1\n",
    "This subseries of the `Learn Python Series` focuses on working with **regular expressions**, also oftentimes abbreviated to the term **regex**. Regular expressions are **text matching patterns**, and are very powerful to use but its syntax is quite formal and for beginners quite difficult to comprehend.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can look at regular expressoins as a specialized programming languaged squeezed inside Python. It empowers you to define \"rules\" you want to match for within a larger string of data. For example \"Is there a phone number on a certain web page?\", or \"Is this a valid email address?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When a lot of text processing is involved, regular expressions are your friend (as long as you know how to use regexes, that is!). When you're developing an application containing lots of code, using regular expressions to find and / or edit parts of the code itself is pretty helpful and common as well. Sys admins dealing with log files, find regular expressions useful as well. When developing a textual search engine, you're obviously also dealing with big volumes of textual data, and again using regular expressions then is useful and common.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nota bene 1:** a word of advise to those new to handling regular expressions in general, not just in Python: regexes can be pretty overwhelming at first sight, but don't feel intimidated by them! I will try to explain everything in the right order, as I always do, and feel free to ask me questions in the comment sections if something is unclear. I'm happy to help!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nota bene 2:** in order to keep things easy-to-follow for beginner programmers, I decided to present the information in this regex subseries in a very specific order. That means: instead of beginning with the \"regex language\" itself, explaining meta characters, pattern syntax, escaping, grouping, sets, etc. right of the bat (which would mean risking beginning programmers felling dazzled and completely overwhelmed with the info presented), I'm first explaining the basic mechanisms (functions, methods, attributes used oftentimes) of the `re` module.\n",
    "Therefore, in this `Handling Regular Expressions Part 1` episode, I will only be using simple, fixed, literal, character matching. Starting from `Part 2` I'll be going over the \"nitty gritty\" of the regex language itself.\n",
